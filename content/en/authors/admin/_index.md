I am a PhD candidate at the Epidemiology Department of [Erasmus MC](https://www.erasmusmc.nl/en/research/groups/causal-inference-group). My research is focused in applying causal inference methods in cohort studies, specifically to emulate target trials for long-term exposures related to dementia and to understand the role of competing events in this setting. 

I am very interested in the concept of open science and collective learning. For this reason I organize [R-Ladies Rotterdam](https://twitter.com/rladiesrdam) and [Reprohack](https://reprohack.github.io/reprohack-hq/). I am also an [RStudio Certified Instructor](https://education.rstudio.com/trainers/people/rojas-saunero+paloma/).

I keep my heart close to home in La Paz, Bolivia.
